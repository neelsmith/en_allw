# Formulating Our Question

[![Iliad 20 image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/VenA/VA268VN-0770.tif&RGN=0.156,0.5435,0.077,0.033&WID=9000&CVT=JPEG)](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA268VN-0770@0.156,0.5435,0.077,0.033)

# Collecting Observations
1. collected instances of ἐν ἄλλῳ from a normalized edition of the scholia
2. filtered the scholia into 2 categories based on length of the comment after the phrase

---

# Close Reading
Melissa, Brian, and Stephanie looked at the 17 "Long Scholia" to divide them into categories

---

# Distant Reading
Melody and Charlie did some fancy computer stuff that they will explain here

---

# What close reading did
- Divided the scholia into categories
  - totally different uses of ἐν ἄλλῳ (geography and time!)
  - referencing the language of another passage to talk about grammatical usage, not how the lines were written
  - rejecting lines instead of offering multiforms
  - actual multiforms or even plus verses

---

# Example A: 

**urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:7.2046** comments on line 7.367

[reinserted lines](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA098RN-0270@0.628,0.4932,0.22,0.0495)

>Elsewhere and here these lines are present: 
>"κέκλυτέ μευ Τρῶες καὶ Δάρδανοι ἠδ' ἐπίκουροι 
>ὄφρ' εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει"

---

# Example B: 

**urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msAim.hmt:12.J1** comments on line 12.457

[half line](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA163VN-0665@0.441,0.292,0.058,0.0338)

>Elsewhere: "στη δ' ἂρ ἐπί οὐδὸν ἰ̈ὼν"

>Line 12.457 in the Venetus A reads: στῆ δὲ μάλ' ἐγγὺς ἰὼν. καὶ ἐρεισαμενος βάλε μέσσους. 

>Suggested multiform line: στη δ' ἂρ ἐπί οὐδὸν ἰ̈ὼν. καὶ ἐρεισαμενος βάλε μέσσους.

# What distant reading revealed

---

# Where do we go from here?
1. Are the scholia working with a notional Iliad?
2. Do some of these multiforms indicate a tradition of working in half line units?
