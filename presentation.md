# ἐν ἄλλῳ: Does it mean what we think it means?

---

# Formulating Our Question

---
# Collecting Observations
1. collected instances of ἐν ἄλλῳ from a normalized edition of the scholia
2. filtered the scholia into 2 categories based on length of the comment after the phrase

---
# Close Reading
Melissa, Brian, and Stephanie looked at the 17 "Long Scholia" to divide them into categories

---
# Distant Reading
Melody and Charlie did some fancy computer stuff that they will explain here

---
# What close reading did
- Divided the scholia into categories
  - totally different uses of ἐν ἄλλῳ (geography and time!)
  - referencing the language of another passage to talk about grammatical usage, not how the lines were written
  - rejecting lines instead of offering multiforms
  - actual multiforms or even plus verses

---
# Example A

# Example B

---
# What distant reading revealed

---
# Where do we go from here?
1. Are the scholia working with a notional Iliad?
  - we can automate a search for: does the proposed reading match what is in the Venetus A?
