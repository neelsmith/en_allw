# Formulating Our Question

[![Iliad 20 image](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/VenA/VA268VN-0770.tif&RGN=0.156,0.5435,0.077,0.033&WID=9000&CVT=JPEG)](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA268VN-0770@0.156,0.5435,0.077,0.033)

# Collecting Observations
1. collected instances of ἐν ἄλλῳ from a normalized edition of the scholia
2. filtered the scholia into 2 categories based on length of the comment after the phrase

---

# Close Reading
We looked at the 17 "Long Scholia" to divide them into categories

---

# Distant Reading

1. found every scholion containing "ἐν ἄλλῳ"
2. found the *Iliad* lines associated with each scholion
3. found lines of the *Iliad* similar to the *Iliad* line above
4. analyzed if the phrase following "ἐν ἄλλῳ" appeared in any of the step 3 lines

---

# What close reading did
- Divided the scholia into categories
  - totally different uses of ἐν ἄλλῳ (geography and time!)
  - referencing the language of another passage to talk about grammatical usage, not how the lines were written
  - rejecting lines instead of offering multiforms
  - actual multiforms or even plus verses

# Example A: Reinserted Lines

[comments on line 7.367](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA098RN-0270@0.628,0.4932,0.22,0.0495)

>Elsewhere and here these lines are present: 
>"κέκλυτέ μευ Τρῶες καὶ Δάρδανοι ἠδ' ἐπίκουροι 
>/ ὄφρ' εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει"

# Example B: Multiforms

[comments on line 12.457](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA163VN-0665@0.441,0.292,0.058,0.0338)

>Elsewhere: "στη δ' ἂρ ἐπί οὐδὸν ἰ̈ὼν"

>Line 12.457 in the Venetus A reads: στῆ δὲ μάλ' ἐγγὺς ἰὼν. καὶ ἐρεισαμενος βάλε μέσσους. 

>Suggested multiform line: στη δ' ἂρ ἐπί οὐδὸν ἰ̈ὼν. καὶ ἐρεισαμενος βάλε μέσσους. 

*This line does NOT appear anywhere in the OCT version of the Iliad*

# What distant reading revealed
- iliad: the quotation appears elsewhere in the *Iliad*
- VA: matches the Venetus A but is not found elsewhere
- lex: they're minor grammatical or spelling variations (like moveable nu)
- hex: a full hexameter that does not appear elsewhere in the *Iliad*
- multiform: a valid multiform that does not appear elsewhere in the *Iliad*
- trash: long scholia that should be thrown out

---
# Breakdown of distant reading

- multiform: 49   (47.11%)
- iliad: 18       (17.30%)
- lex: 16         (15.38%)
- trash: 12       (11.53%)
- VA: 8           (7.69%)
- hex:2           (1.92%)

# Where do we go from here?

**Processes:**
1. Refine the process of fuzzy matching
1. Do more close reading

**Questions:**
1. What does this say about the scribe's process: Are the scholia working with a notional Iliad or other Iliad manuscripts?
1. Do some of these multiforms indicate a tradition of working in half line units?
